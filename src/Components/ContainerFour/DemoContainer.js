        In this uncertain world, one never knows when or if a personal situation
        or hardship might occur, rendering one incapable of taking care of their
        personal health or affairs. When that situation strikes, it is vitally
        important that comprehensive legal documents are in place that make
        known the desires and wishes of the incapacitated party. For example, if
        a person dies without a will, the State of Texas applies a formula to
        the family history to decide who inherits the assets of the deceased.
        This cold, impersonal method of resolution does not take into account
        any stated desires of the decedent; rather, the formula many times
        requires property to end up in the hands of a party of whom the decedent
        had no intent to benefit. For more details on this issue, you are
        encouraged to read the article in the TLD Library pertaining to wills
        and probate, along with the accompanying video. In non-death situations,
        it is still extremely important that one designates a trusted person to
        make health-care decisions for them and carry out financial affairs in
        the best interest of the incapacitated person. Failure to have the
        correct documents in place could lead to extreme health and financial
        hardships due to unclear authority and fear of liability. Even in
        situations where death or incapacity is not an issue, many times an
        individual needs to appoint another party to act on their behalf in a
        matter, such as the closing on a house purchase when one of the buyers
        is unable to attend. A Statutory Durable Power of Attorney is extremely
        helpful in facilitating the completion of normal everyday financial
        matters. A prudent consumer should at the very least invest in five
        basic estate-planning documents: 1) a Last Will and Testament, which
        sets forth a person’s clear desires as to the distribution of their
        assets upon death; 2) a Statutory Durable Power of Attorney which
        appoints another person to take care of financial issues in your absence
        or upon your disability; 3) a Medical Power of Attorney which appoints
        another person to make health-care decisions for you in the event you
        are incapacitated; 4) a HIPAA Authorization (Health Insurance
        Portability and Accountability Act), which authorizes another person to
        have access to your medical records, and 5) a Directive to Physicians,
        sometimes known as a “living will”, which instructs doctors and medical
        personel not to use artificial means of prolonging your life if death is
        otherwise imminent and irreversible. In this uncertain world, one never
